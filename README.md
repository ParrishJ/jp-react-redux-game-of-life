# Jared Parrish’s React/Redux Implementation of Conway’s Game of Life :microbe:

Conway’s Game of Life is a classic computer science simulation that employs a few simple rules to create cellular automata that “live”, “die”, and create some stunning patterns throughout their collective lifecycles.

My Implementation uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [React-BootStrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap), and a handful of other libraries to create an aesthetically pleasing and performant model of John Conway’s famous game.
